[The Vasa](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)>), was a Swedish warship which sank on her maiden voyage leaving
Stockholm harbour.

I was approached by photographer Adam Davies to work on building
a digital exhibition for his collaboration with Joan Wickersham.

Being a digital representation of a gallery, typography and
spacing was extremely important. Adam and I continually worked
with the specifics and launched it, timing it to feature with [The American Scandinavian Foundation](http://www.amscan.org)
and [Scandinavia House](http://www.scandinaviahouse.org).

As the exhibition has finished, you can find the site avilable at an [archive](https://shipwreck.tommyp.org/)
