			<p>
				When I started at Deliveroo, Engineering was 40 people and the whole codebase was in one
				Application.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time I left, Engineering was nearly 10 times as big and although we still had a Rails
				monolith, there were a lot of microservices in various languages in different parts of the
				stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked on a lot of different projects there, like porting the Menu page from Angular to
				React, allowing Restaurants to deliver food themselves and decomping the listing page to a
				new Go Application. I even worked on a change that the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan <a

				>.
