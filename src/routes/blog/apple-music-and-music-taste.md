A few months ago I decided to give Apple Music a shot.

I've been a Spotify user on and off for years. Since I DJ, I resisted for a long time and stuck to listening to music that I had downloaded over the years.

TODO: some stuff about using Spotify

So why switch?

## Offline support

I'm begging people who work in Tech to try and use their products with Airplane Mode on. Spotify must be trying to hit an API every chance it gets, because it constantly throws up an error alert when it doesn't have network access. Although I work from home 100% of the time these days, when I take the tube and want to listen to some music, I don't want to be told off for having no network access when I'm several metres underground.

Apple Music will happily work away without network access.

## The Apple Ecosystem

I've been a Mac user for more than 15 years. I've got an iPhone, Airpod Pros, Apple Watch and a personal 14" Macbook Pro, along with one for work. It's safe to say I'm in deep when it comes to Apple's products.
