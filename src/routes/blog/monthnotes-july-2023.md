[Wettest July on record](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/01/northern-ireland-and-parts-of-england-had-wettest-july-on-record). Again, it certainly felt like it.

## Car trouble

I bought a new car and had a whole host of problems with it, only to discover that there's not the same consumer protection laws when you get a car on finance. After 2 weeks of stress I managed to get the dealership to take it back for a little Ford Fiesta. It had a Northern Irish registration, so I consider it to be fate.

## Wet camping

We went camping 2 weekends in a row, with the first being a messy festival 40th when it rained all day on the Saturday. Luckily we had some covered areas and eventually it stopped at about 1am.

I was meant to DJ on the Friday night, but a power cut delayed that to the Saturday. Alongside my very talented friends, I had a great time playing.

## Dry camping

The second weekend was at Eweleaze Farm - a family friendly temporary campsite near Weymouth that's full of fields, food stalls, and some entertainment. We walked along the coast one day to a nice pub.
