2022 was a very good year.

## January

In December 2021 I went through what can only be described as a professional crisis. I was working somewhere that wasn't really working out - I felt completely unmotivated and it wasn't what I wanted to work on. I've always been a creative person, and coding my ~stupid~ ideas was an outlet for that. I realised I wanted to build those stupid ideas for other people too. [Lee Martin](https://www.leemartin.com/) was a big inspiration for what I wanted to work on.

But that was in 2021, so I quit and finished up that job right at the start of 2022.

I decided that I was going to take some time off and learn some new things.

In the time off, I spent a lot of time enjoying the frosty surroundings of Walthamstow.

## February

After a few lazy weeks, I rinsed through courses from [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/) and [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses). It was a nice time. The goal of those courses was to set myself up more for the kind of work that I wanted. WebGL, Creative JavaScript and Node.js were some of what I worked on. It was also around this time that I started some freelance work for my friend Conor at [AllotMe](https://www.allotme.co.uk/). It was a good experience and a nice intro the world of proper freelancing.

## March

I did a few more weeks of contracting and we started renovating the house we bought last year. First up was the bathroom, which looks amazing now that it's done, but the people who did it were a bit useless. Shoddy plumbing, things out of alignment, and not explaining the process properly to us led to a lot of extra time. We gave them a deadline because Lila's Mum was visiting from Canada and the old bathroom was an ugly deathtrap.

## April

I started at [Castrooms](https://castrooms.com/). The first few weeks involved lots of planning. It'd been a while since I sat in a meeting room covering a wall with post-it notes. A tradition I was first introduced to at [GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/10/12/transforming-transport-content-the-journey-so-far/). It helped lay out the framework for what we had to build and how we were going to work. Big props to [Will](https://www.myddelton.co.uk/) for leading all of those sessions. As the months went on we did a few more of them. It's still early days for us at Castrooms, so I reckon we'll be going through many more post-its.

## May

May was when the year started to get really busy. I went to my favourite music festival, [Bangface](http://bangface.com/) which is always hectic. It's got a lot of the music that I love, so I always have a good time. At the end of the months I went to a friends stag do in Ireland and rolled in a quick trip home to see my family. Overall, a pretty heavy month.

## June

Really ramping up into a busy Summer, we started June with Lila's 40th party. Straight after, we flew to Austria for a wedding. A few days in Vienna followed by a trip to rural Austria. Vienna's a cool city, but it was amazing to get out into the countryside and see some green fields.

The wedding was in Lackenbach Palace. A beautiful venue. It was a scorching hot day and with half the attendees coming from Ireland, we were hiding in the shade.

On the last day of the trip, my friend Troy found a public pool at the seat of a mountain with a castle on top of it. We had a lovely afternoon in the Sun drinking radlers, swimming, and chatting. It was a great end to the trip.

Straight afer we got back, Lila's Mum came to visit from Canada. She's great fun.e showed her all round Walthamstow and met up with some friends.
