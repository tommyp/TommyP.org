Many years ago, I thought about building a site that just told
you if you should wear shorts or not. That's it.

It uses your location and a little bit of logic to give you an
easy yes or no.

I've used it as a way to experiment with new languages and
frameworks. It's been Ruby, Go and Node, but the latest
incarnation is plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

I had worked my way through a course in making art with code and
wanted to show off my new skills. As part of the 2021 rebuild, I
made a trippy generative background with WebGL. It even starts
semi-randomly each time you refresh.
