I like seeing how I can use two APIs to make something fun and I wanted to build a side project, but I couldn't think of any ideas. I ended up building a side project idea generator so that I don't have this problem in future.

It was a fun little project that I built over a few days and I took the opportunity to get a domain hack just for it.
