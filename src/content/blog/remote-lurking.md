It's easy to always think back to March 2020, and what that did to us all, but instead I like to think back to Summer 2020 - with the big C keeping us inside for the past 3 months, everyone was desperate to socialise. Many of us bent the rules without breaking them, until restrictions temporarily allowed for outdoor socialising.

The yearning to meet friends was so desperate for my ~Partner~ Wife and I that we even became friends with neighbours and strangers. Some of those strangers became good friends, and recently attended our wedding.

But time moves on from that glorious Summer, and now we're in the post-pandemic world. Hugging friends and shaking hands is allowed again. Being inside with strangers is fine. But for most computery jobs, we're all still remote working.

## The case for Remote Work

Most of us have been doing this for over 4 years now. I think we all have our own reasons that we enjoy it. For me, life seems to be at a slower pace. Without a commute, I can fit in a run before work.
