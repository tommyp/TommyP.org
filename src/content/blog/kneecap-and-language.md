If you don't know them, Kneecap are a hip hop trio from West Belfast. Famous for mostly rapping in Irish and being very politically vocal, they've been getting bigger and bigger. Their popularity has recently reached a crescendo, with a Glastonbury performance, [releasing their debut album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Wt3uI8G0yhXSvC0jAl9Cg?si=UkD9sKT5Rbm6vjEx0e9jrA), and even a film.

I'm a huge fan. I've been to a few shows, seen the film twice, and managed to get into their album launch party in Dalston. I'm also from the same bit of Belfast. My Irish is limited to a few words and sentences, but I understand enough.

Living in London, I know more mainland Brits than the average person in Ireland might. Most of those friends I know through music, and they know how much I'm into Kneecap. This has led to many late night conversations over Kneecap, the Irish language, and being from West Belfast.

Kneecap, and I, are both from a part of the world with a distinct cultural identity. One that, outside of the North of Ireland, is rarely shown in media. A history of music and language exist alongside distrust of the British state and Royal Family, solidarity with Palestine, and a dark sense of humour about our turbulent past.

Outside of BBC NI, [UTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTV_(TV_channel)?useskin=vector), and some films, stories from Irish catholics weren't heard. Let's not forget that it wasn't that long ago that [our elected representative's voices were literally not allowed on TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988%E2%80%931994_British_broadcasting_voice_restrictions?useskin=vector). What might've been deemed _politically sensitive_ to some, is a way of life where I come from.

Now though, alongside Derry Girls, Kneecap is telling our story to the world.

Listen to the album, watch the film, and maybe learn _cÃºpla focal_.

# Honorable mentions

- ðŸŽ® Soaking up all of Elden Ring as I near the end. What an incredible game.
- ðŸŽ® Balatro is very addictive. I might be developing a problem.
- ðŸŽ® I played a bit more of Chants of Sennar on a recent flight. I don't think it's a perfect game, but it's an interesting and fun take on the [Metroidbrainia](https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block) genre.
- ðŸ“º Married at First Sight UK is as crazy as always.
- ðŸ“º [From](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDHqAj4eJcM) is a Lost-like show with 3 seasons that I'd never heard of. I'm getting very into it.
- ðŸ“º Taskmaster Season 18 is great. It's unfortunate that dickheads have made it all about Rosie Jones and how her disability makes it less enjoyable for them.
