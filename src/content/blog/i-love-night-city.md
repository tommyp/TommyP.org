> _“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”_

When William Gibson begun Neuromancer with that, _a dead channel_ meant static. As technology has changed, so has the meaning of that description. We begin the story in Chiba City with our downtrodden hacker, Henry Case, as he is given a chance at redemption. The story deals with technology, sentient Artificial Intelligence, Space Colonisation, simulated reality in a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity?useskin=vector). Themes that we're used to now, but at the time, this was groundbreaking.

Cyberpunk as a genre started with Neuromancer. Through Ghost in The Shell, The Matrix, and many others, we end up with Cyberpunk 2077.

In Cyberpunk 2077, we explore Night City. Sitting on the Californian coastline and independent from the New United States of America, Night City exists as a capitalist maximum in a society ruled by corporations.

The technological singularity has reached a crescendo - Humans swap their organic limbs and organs for artificial versions, giving them an advantage in the workplace, sports, and sex. Memories can be recorded and played back as Braindances, leading to a whole new industry of recorded entertainment, crime, death, and pornography. NC's leading cab company is run by an AI that doesn't ask questions. The highest earners in society play fast and lose with those who live literally and figuratively below them, but the poorest have no choice but take out huge loans and upgrade their bodies to have any chance at escaping poverty.

Cyberware surgeries are done by _Ripperdocs_ - back alley surgeons with a vibe more akin to a tattoo studio than a hospital. Ditching your 'ganic parts for chrome doesn't come without risks though - although Cyberpsychosis is rare, nobody knows what causes it. Some people with chrome lose it and lash out, sometimes killing others in the process. Even if your brain survives the upgrades, since you've got cyberware, you'll need to take [immunosuppressive drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug?useskin=vector) for the rest of your life.

While human limits can be surpassed, healthcare is still an issue. Ambulance services are non-existent, so if you've got the money, you pay for a Trauma Team subscription. They'll monitor your vitals and swoop in via Arial Vehicle, dropping their crack team of paramedics who are armed with enough firepower for any issue.

All of these connected devices come with other dangers too. _Netrunners_ can hack and control any connected devices. Security cameras, lights, doors, windows, cars, guns, eyes, ears, limbs, and even your impulses, could all be coerced into doing what the attacker desires.

Gang warfare ravages the city. The Tyger Claws rule Japantown, Little China, and Kabuki, while the Valentinos own Heywood. The Voodoo Boys specialise in Netrunning, ruling through extortion and dealing in cyberware. Even in 2077, Maelstrom goes for more chrome than the general population. If you're unlucky, you might be an innocent bystander in daily dispute between the gangs.

You'll encounter back alley deals, some of which have clearly went wrong for one of the parties involved. Domestics are common too, but intervening might not be advisable - you don't know if someone has Mantis Blades arms ready to strike.

Don't worry though, there's plenty of new friends out there for you to meet too! The law abiding denizens of this wonderful city are just as interesting.

Night City is pure visual cacophony. Neon signs pulse along lively streets filled with markets and traders. Graffiti follows buildings and walkways like urban snakes. Advertisements fill screens, persuading you to buy synth-meat or promoting the newest episode of Watson Whore. Above you, roads, public transit, and Aerodynes pass between gargantuan residential mega-buildings and corporate headquarters, huge blocks of steel and concrete that blot out the sun. Holographic beams shoot out of the tallest buildings, occupying premium adspace that trails off into the sky. Music, sirens, disagreements, conversations, and the occasional sound of gunfire fill the air.

After dark, it's like the city gets upgrade. More lights and more sounds push the limits of your attention span. Head to famous clubs like The Afterlife, The Totentanz, to get a real
