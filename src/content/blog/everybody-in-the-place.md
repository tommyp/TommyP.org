Last week I managed to catch [Reverb](https://www.180studios.com/reverb) - an exhibition that features many pieces by different artists all on the subject of music culture. I went on a Friday afternoon, so it was quiet and I got to take my time through it. One piece really stuck with me, one of those _films on loops_ kind of thing. It was just over an hour long but I sat and watched the whole film, which I never do.

It was called _Everybody In The Place - An Incomplete History of Britain 1984 -1992 by Jeremy Deller_. It's a recording of lecture that the artist, Jeremy Deller, gave to an A Level politics class. It covers the introduction of house music to the UK, how that music became more electronic, and eventually, how [Acid House came to dominate Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Summer_of_Love?useskin=vector).

Deller puts forward a theory that Acid House was part of a pivotal moment in British history. Happening just after the [Miner's Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984%E2%80%931985_United_Kingdom_miners%27_strike?useskin=vector), it was part of a shift in how people, and especially young people, socialised.
