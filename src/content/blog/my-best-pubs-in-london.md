Back in the [olden times](/blog/remote-lurking), going into work on Tuesday meant picking up a free copy of [Timeout](https://www.timeout.com/london) before getting on the Tube to read all about the goings on in London. Now, there's no print edition, but they still update their website every Tuesday. Just last week, they published their _indisputable, irrefutable and 100 percent accurate list_ of the [the best 50 pubs in London](https://www.timeout.com/london/bars-and-pubs/the-best-pubs-in-london).

My favourite beer blog, [Boak and Bailey](https://boakandbailey.com/), posted this in response:

Now I love hanging out in pubs, and I've spent most of my adult life in London, so here's my own list of best pubs in London.

## Auld Shillelagh, Stoke Newington (The)

A legend of an Irish pub in London. The Auld Shillelagh serves all the standard drinks that you might expect from an Irish pub, and although I'm not really a Guinness drinker, I have been reliably informed that they pour it well. Once when I was in there on a Friday night a proper seafood seller was coming round, so I helped myself to a little pot of prawn cocktail. Like a little

## Blue Posts, Berwick Street Market, Soho (The)

With an interior that looks like it hasn't changed from the 70s The Blue Posts feels like a proper old [battle cruiser](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=battle%20cruiser). It gets very busy in the evenings, but also a lovely spot to grab a table with a book during the day. [There are several pubs called The Blue Posts all within or near to Soho](https://londonist.com/london/food-and-drink/the-blue-posts-pub-crawl), but it's not really known why, so make sure you get the right one.

## Bradley's Spanish Bar, Tottenham Court Road

About as Spanish as San Miguel, Bradley's is a little red oasis hidden away down a side street. An ancient looking jukebox sits just inside the door, where you might see a similarly aged regular sat at the bar. There's more space in the basement if it's too full. [There isn't much to the pub, but the history is an interesting one](https://londoninbits.substack.com/p/bradleys-lager-and-shots-in-no-mans).

## Cock Tavern, Hackney Central (The)

A craft beer pub in Hackney isn't exactly original, but The Cock is one of the best. The beer selection is stellar, the decor is classic, the atmosphere is solid, and the 'beer garden' is laughably bleak. [The eponymous Cock was even kidnapped, but eventually returned in September 2022](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiSbggAIgVU/?img_index=1)

## Crooked Billet, Clapton
## Cross Keys, Covent Garden (The)
## Dicken's Inn, Wapping (The)
## Euston Tap, Euston (The)
## Exmouth Arms, Farringdon
## Faltering Fullback, Finsbury Park (The)
## George, London Bridge (The)
## Howl at The Moon, Hoxton

Most of the pubs on this list are simply because I enjoy being in them, but The Howl is different. When I first moved to London, I lived just off of Hoxton Street

## Island Queen, Islington (The)
## Lamb, Highbury & Islington (The)
## Lord Nelson, Southwark
## Lyric, Picadilly (The)
## Mannions Prince Arthur, Tottenham Hale
## Nag's Head, Walthamstow (The)

There aren't many places that have as much personality as The Nag's Head. The landlady, Flossie, is practically a celebrity, and you'll see her there being followed around the pub by her poodles. Famously filled with cats, one by one they've all passed away over the years, so the bar is flanked on one side by a cat shrine, with a David Bowie shrine on the other. It all feels a bit like drinking in an old lady's living room. And best of all for a DINK couple living in Walthamstow, it's a childfree pub.

## Pelt Trader, Cannon Street
## Pembury Tavern, Hackney Downs (The)
## Pineapple, Camden (The)
## Pride of Spitalfields, Spitalfields (The)
## Seven Stars, Holborn (The)
## Tamesis Dock, Vauxhaull
## Toucan, Soho (The)
## Wenlock Arms, Old Street (The)
