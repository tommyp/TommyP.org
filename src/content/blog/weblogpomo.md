I'm back from holiday and catching up on my RSS feeds, when I spot [Lewis Dale](https://lewisdale.dev) posting about [posting every day in May](https://lewisdale.dev/post/weblogpomo-2024/). [WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) is an idea from [Anne Sturdivant](https://omg.anniegreens.lol/). Like Lewis, I'm _also_ overly confident about signing up to Advent of Code and not bothering past day 2. At least with blogging I have things to write about. So why not?

I'm going to try and do it every day, but not be too hard on myself if I miss one. Life can get in the way of sitting on the computer sometimes.

Expect some post-Florida reports, thoughts on film, TV, and videogames, and maybe some wildcards in the mix.
