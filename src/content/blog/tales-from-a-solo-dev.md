Right at the end of 2023 I finished up working at [CastRooms](https://castrooms.com/). I was one of four people there, and the only dev, although I liked to say that I was the best developer at the company.

Many in our industry think about joining a startup from day one. Having done it, I do think it's something everyone should try if you get the chance, but it's not easy. It can be hard fucking work.

The CastRooms product was a DJ video streaming service with a simultaneous video call. Far away from _strings going in and out of a database_ that I'd done before. By my own admission, I was trying to do some complex and weird things with audio and video in the browser.

Working by myself was tough, but here's some lessons that I learned along the way.

## Do what you want

Don’t question your own work too much. Your job isn’t to write perfect code, if such a thing even exists. Your job is to write code and ships features and and ship them as fast as possible. You don't need an imaginary fellow developer in your head whispering nit-picky comments in your ear. You'll be merging +2000 line PRs and shouldn't have thoughts like that.

It has to be done, and has to be done quickly, so trust your own instincts.

## Read the docs

You won’t be able to talk to others about your issues, and sometimes, that is brutally defeating. In a team, I'd post a message in Slack, but without other developers to work with, who do I turn to?

I had to get good at not just reading, but finding docs. API references sit high up in the results, but finding the right blog posts and Stack Overflow pages can be more difficult. Learning the [Google](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/google-search-tips-youll-want-to-learn) or [DDG](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/) tricks over many years came in dead handy.

When you do find what you think might be the right page, take your time and try to understand what you're trying to find.

## Cut your losses

Sometimes, an approach to a problem didn't quite work for me. Many times I had to start a new branch and try again. Maybe that wouldn't be the case on a team, where tickets can be discussed and planned in advance, but when you're on your own you've got to try what you think might be right.

If it doesn't work out, don't beat yourself up. Take what you've learnt and try again.

## Be proud

Not everyone gets to be the ~~only~~ top developer at the company. You'll have no choice but to do every single task that comes your way. You should shout and share your accomplishments
